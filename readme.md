## Introduction

The language-learning platform Duolingo has over 100 million monthly active users who can select any of their 40 offered languages. The game-like style of learning works great for most languages, but what if a user wants to learn a language that doesn't use text or audio? Currently Duolingo does not offer any lessons for American Sign Language (ASL). Enter Duofingo- a revolutionary tool for users to practice their ASL skills at their own pace with just a computer.
